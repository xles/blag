Mini blag for php.
Nothing really interesting, I was bored and figured I needed someplace to
rant about my experiences while learning "proper" web development. That is
to say, while playing around with Ruby on Rails and Django...

I'm using a whole lot of old code from previous projects, rewriting and
refactoring as I please.
